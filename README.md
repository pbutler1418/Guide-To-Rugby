<h1> Guide-To-Rugby </h1>
Your one stop shop to stay up to date with all rugby related info in the world.
The app will allow the user to research multiple aspects of the game from leagues 
and teams all over the world. 

<h2>Potential Components</h2>
  <h3>Match Center</h3>
    Will constantly update scores and results from games as they finish.
  <h3>Team Info</h3>
    Will display information such as schedule, coach, captain, and etc for the user.
  <h3>League Info</h3>
    With rugby being a truly global game, there are leagues all over the world that are exciting and worth keeping on top of.
  <h3>Player Info</h3>
    If the user wants to know the bio or injury update for a specific player, this is where that information would be displayed.
  <h3>Highlights</h3>
    Similar to the match center component, this page will conitnuously update with highlights as they are posted.

<h2>API USED</h2>
  The api for this project is going to be The Sports DB: Sports MetaData (https://www.thesportsdb.com/).

<h2>MVP</h2>
  1. MVP for this app will be to create an app that not only displays the correct information for each responsive component, but narrows down information based on the user's input, displaying information 
  for a specific league or team for example.
  2. The highlights and match center page successfully update and the highlights page actually plays the videos.
  3. Good looking design.

<h2>Post MVP</h2>
  Post MVP for the project will be to find and implement a new API that will display even more information and
  the creation of a "Discussion/Forum" page where a user can add their own rugby opinions to the page.

<h2>SWOT Analysis</h2>
  I have been having some difficulty with connecting user input to the API call. I have been remedying this by looking over passed examples. My second concern is since we haven't worked with videos yet, I am a little worried if there will be any unexpected issues in getting a video to play.
